This is a toy chat application powered by websockets!  It is built using React
and a very simple node server.

## Running this application

This chat app is composed of separate server and client processes.  To use the application, you'll need to run both.  Both are set up using standard node package files.

To start the server:

* Navigate to ./server
* Run `yarn install`
* Run `yarn start`

To start the client:

* Navigate to ./client
* Run `yarn install`
* Run `yarn start`

This should launch the application in a browser at http://localhost:3000.  If
you duplicate your tab, you should be able to send messages from one tab to the
other!
